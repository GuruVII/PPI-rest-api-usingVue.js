# PPI-rest-api using VueJS

> A Vue.js project

## Basic description
This project is a rewrite using VueJS of my contribution to [this](https://github.com/Pirate-Parties-International/PPI-rest-api) project, which I had originally written in AngularJS.

## Prerequisites
Node.js, npm

## Build Setup
``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# to build the project
npm run build

```
## Things that still need to be added
* page that shows posts instead of pictures
* options to filter/narrow displayed items
* loading page when scrolling surpasses the ability to acquire data though the API
* error page
